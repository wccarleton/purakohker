    "text": "Koh Ker, once a powerful royal center during the Angkorian period, remains one of Cambodia’s most intriguing and understudied ancient cities. In the 10th century CE, Jayavarman IV briefly moved the Angkorian court to Koh Ker, where he initiated an ambitious program of monumental construction and hydraulic engineering before the court returned to Angkor after just 16 years. Despite its historic importance, the long-term development and later occupation of Koh Ker have remained poorly understood.\nThis collaborative project, led by the Max Planck Institute of Geoanthropology in partnership with the National Authority of Preah Vihear, seeks to uncover the deep urban and environmental history of Koh Ker. We combine advanced sediment coring, magnetic susceptibility profiling, and high-resolution environmental analyses to reconstruct the city’s growth, persistence, and decline over time.\nOur pilot work has demonstrated that terrestrial coring — complemented by magnetic susceptibility data — can reveal buried cultural layers even in the absence of visible artifacts. Paired radiocarbon dating of charcoal and bulk sediments, alongside isotopic, palaeobotanical, and geochemical proxies, is helping us build a process-based model of carbon dynamics in tropical soils. This approach not only refines our understanding of Koh Ker’s chronology but also opens new possibilities for reconstructing ancient land use, fire regimes, and agricultural practices across Southeast Asia.\nBy integrating spatial and temporal data at unprecedented resolution, this project aims to establish Koh Ker as a key case study for understanding the co-evolution of cities and landscapes in tropical environments. Through ongoing collaboration and open scientific exchange, we hope to shed new light on the dynamic relationship between Angkorian urbanism and its environmental context.\nWe thank our partners at NAPV for their vital support and look forward to sharing future discoveries as this work progresses."
